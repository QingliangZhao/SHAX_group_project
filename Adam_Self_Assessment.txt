  Adam's Self Assessment

    My main role in the project was creating and maintaining the database for the project. Another role I had was creating and helping to maintain the GitHub repository. This role was the more difficult one since we had problems merging and needed help from the instructional staff. I was able to help out other team members with debugging code during some office hours sessions as well. Some of our greatest challenges as a group were trying to decide on the final fit and finish of our project. We had competing ideas on what was needed and not needed. Trying to find middle ground with strong personalities can be challenging at times. We reached out for a 3rd parties opinion which helped us come to consensus.
    Our man method of communication was over slack. We also meet during class on zoom as well as using google meets to meet on the weekend. It was difficult working through problems on slack just because it was just using written words for communication. We were able to work through a lot bigger problems more quickly when we were using zoom and google meets. I think one of our strengths of our team is that we were very focused on the final goal of coming up with an impressive project that could have some real world uses. We had some very talented programmers in our group which made our group very strong as well. 
    I expressed a desire to use this bootcamp to hopefully get a job in the medical field someday. We decided to go down the medical path for our project because of that. We found this dataset that seemed like it would lend itself well fo answering the question, “What heath factors correlate to CVD?” Xiao is very familiar with machine learning models so the final machine model we landed on was the Gradient Boosting Tree. It was able to provide us with the most accuracy. The result of our analysis was the age, weight, and cholesterol levels were the most positively correlated factors for predicting heart disease.
