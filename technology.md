# Technologies Used

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
We are using Python to analysis our data. For our dataset, the "age" column unit is days, so we converted days to years. We used matplotlib and seaborn to visualize our data. Pandas to get our csv file into a dataframe and used both numpy and pandas to interact with the dataframe.

Python Libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- sklearn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Database
- PostgresSQL to store our data
- pgAdmin4 for working with data imported
- QuickDBD for Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD)
- SQLAlchemy

## Machine Learning
sciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is to predict the probability of having cardiovascular disease.

sklearn modules:
- LogisticRegression
- DecisionTreeClassifier
- GradientBoostingClassifier
- RandomForestClassifier
- KNeighborsClassifier

## Dashboard
We are planning to display our results through an interactive web application where the user inputs their personal data, and the website will respond with the probability of the user having cardiovasular disease.
