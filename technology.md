# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
We are using Python to analysis our data. The dataset we found from Kaggle is already cleaned, but if we find that it needs farther cleaning, we will be using Pandas. 

## Database Storage
We are using PostgresSQL to store our data, so far we plan to use only one dataset, so we won't be using PostgresSQL to create relationships between differnt tables.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is to predict the whether a patient has or doesn't have cardiovascular disease. We haven't decided how to split the data yet.

## Dashboard
We are planning to display our results through a chatbot where the user inputs their personal data and the chatbot will respond whether the user has or doesn't have cardiovascular disease. We will have other visualizations of the results of our logistic regression as well.
