# Cardiovascular Chatbot Project
"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a class of disease that involves the heart or blood vessels." "It is the leading cause of death in all areas of the world expect Africa. Together CVD resulted in 17.9 million deaths in 2015, up from 12.3 million in 1990", but yet it is estimated that up to 90% of CVD may be preventable."

Knowing this our group became interested in predicting whether a person is at risk of cardiovascular disease based of personal data (height, weight, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, cholesterol levels, glucose levels, etc). We want to present this through a chatbot where users interact with a chatbot by inputing their personal data, and the chatbot responds with the possibility of having cardiovascular disease. If time permits, we want to reccommend users course of action such as healthy eating, exercise, limiting alcohol intake based off of the chatbot prediction of having or not having cardiovascular disease.

**Disclaimer**: This is not an official recommendation of what patients should do. Please call a medical professional if you are at risk of cardiovascular disease.

# Data
[Kaggle's Cardiovascular Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset/notebooks)

"There are 3 types of input features:

Objective: factual information;
Examination: results of medical examination;
Subjective: information given by the patient.

Features:
- Age (Objective Feature, age, int (days))
- Height (Objective Feature, height int (cm))
- Weight (Objective Feature, weight, float (kg)) 
- Gender (Objective Feature, gender, categorical code)
- Systolic blood pressure (Examination Feature, ap_hi int)
- Diastolic blood pressure (Examination Feature, ap_lo int)
- Cholesterol (Examination Feature, cholesterol, 1: normal, 2: above normal, 3: well above normal)
- Glucose (Examination Feature, gluc, 1: normal, 2: above normal, 3: well above normal)
- Smoking (Subjective Feature, smoke, binary)
- Alcohol intake (Subjective Feature, alco, binary)
- Physical activity (Subjective Feature, active, binary)
- Presence or absence of cardiovascular disease (Target Variable, cardio, binary)

There are 70,000 records of patients data."

# Question 
We are going to use the data to perform a logistic regression.

Can a logistic regression predict whether a patient has cardiovasular disease with moderate accuracy?
