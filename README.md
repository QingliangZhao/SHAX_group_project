# COVID-19 Chatbot Project
On December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, COVID-19, an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2, was first identified and has since spread through out the world. "As of 14 August 2020, more than 21 million cases have been reported across 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 761,000 deaths (Wikipedia)." 

Everyone's everyday life has been dispersed by COVID-19, and our group would like to help others detemine the severity level (Mild, Moderate, Severe, None) if they were to catch COVID-19 and if time permits give others a course of action based off of the inputs the user give us.

We would like to present this through a chatbot where users can input their age, symptoms they have to determine the severity level (Mild, Moderate, Severe, None) if they were to have COVID.

**Disclaimer**: This is not an official recommendation of what patients should do. Please call a medical professional if you think you have COVID-19.

# Data
[Kaggle's COVID-19 Symptoms Checker](https://www.kaggle.com/harshaggarwal7/covid-19-symptom-analysis)

- Contact: Has the person been exposed to a COVID-19 Patient"

There are 316,800 rows in this dataset.

# Question 
We are going to use the data to perform a logistic regression.

Can a logistic regression predict the severity level of a patient with moderate accuracy?
